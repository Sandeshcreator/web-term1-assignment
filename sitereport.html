	 		<p>I have separated my coding time into three points. Once I saw the assignment brief on NILE, I started to search for a design for a website. Once I finalised my design for a website, I drew a layout in copy roughly. Drawing the layout of a website helps me a lot when building a website. For the first week, it was very hard for me to code. All the tags were new, and it takes a lot of time to understand the usage of code in the correct place. At this point, I was more concerned with making layouts than coding.</p>

	 		At the midpoint of coding, I started to push my code to the git hub. At first, I used to search for my coding problems on Google and YouTube, but then I found a website named W3School, which helped me a lot with solving problems. I faced a lot of problems in the github branch, so I deleted that branch because it was affecting my main branch. Tutor and university slides helped me a lot to solve the problems I faced in coding and on GitHub. At this point, I was more concerned with writing content than focusing on design or layout.

	 		At the end of the coding, it was a little easier, but I was not really perfect at coding. Now I am picking the appropriate color for the website and planning to give it a better look. I was gathering information to make the website responsive. At the end of building this website, I learned many things about coding and the correct use of tags.
